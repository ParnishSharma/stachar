## Workflow

* The Home Page informs the user about the KYC process, instructs them on how to complete the steps and also has the accessibility feature of changing the language as per the user's requirement.
* In the Registration Form page the user can enter their personal details like Name, Phone Number, etc.
* Then the user is prompted to give access to their device's webcam so that their current photograph may be taken.

* That finishes your e-KYC!
